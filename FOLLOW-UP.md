# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would refine my styling, I would add a feature to select the desired itinerary and be brought to a details page with more info. 

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I am proud of the styling because I did not use much of what was given to me. 

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spent more time on the styling and getting it to work correctly with Next.js. Honstly I did not find anything too difficult and enjoyed the project a lot. 

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I really liked the test. I love building out fun little projects such as this. I did not have any issues besides having more time to devote to it. I think it was well put together and is a great test.
